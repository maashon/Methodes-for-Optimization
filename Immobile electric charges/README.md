#  Immobile Electric charge Optimization

the document is trying to propose the solution to the following question:

Suppose that there is some given number m ∈ N of immobile electric charges fixed at some
points of the 2-dimensional plane. We want to place some given n ∈ N number of additional
charged particles (i.e. not including the previous m fixed charges) along a circle centered at
the origin, in such a way that the total potential of the system is minimized.
Supposing that all formerly placed and new charges are equal, formalize this optimization
problem. Which known algorithm would you recommend to solve the problem with? Demonstrate an approximate solution for a parameter setting of your choice.
