# second order finite differencing method for approximating Hessians

The code is trysing to solve the following question:

. Implement the second order finite differencing method for approximating Hessians, then
modify the implementation of Newton’s method (Newton.m) such that it only relies on the
objective function’s values to approximate the required gradient and Hessian values.
