# visualize the square penalty’s effect

The code tries to solve the following problem:

Implement a function to visualize the square penalty’s effect used in equality constrained
optimization problems for functions of two variables. The input should be the objective
function f, the constraints g, and the parameter %. The function should create a 3D plot of
the original and the modified objective functions. Provide some samples (e.g. optimizing on
a line, on a circle or some other nice region of your choice).
