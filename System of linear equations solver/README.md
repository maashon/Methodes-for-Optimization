# System of linear equations solver

The provided code tries to solve this problem:

Implement a system of linear equations solver to iteratively compute the solution of Ax = b,
(A ∈ R
n×n
symmetric positive definite, b ∈ R
n
) using the conjugate gradient algorithm with
a suitable objective. Try to avoid using line search and ensure termination in a finite number
of steps.
