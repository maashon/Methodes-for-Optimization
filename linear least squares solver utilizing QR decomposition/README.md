# linear least squares solver utilizing QR decomposition


The code tries to solve the following problem:

Implement a linear least squares solver utilizing QR decomposition. Improve the numerical
stability of the method for the case of ri,i â‰ˆ 0 entries appearing in the diagonal of the
upper-triangle matrix. You may use the code for the SVD-based solution (linear_LSq.m)
as reference.
